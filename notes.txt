flashlight through PCB, no shadowing -> 2 layer PCB

Jetta company manufactured the board

IOC0-7 hints at 8-bit I/O port on MCU

figure out size of memory array -> measure size of unit cell -> divide entire length by measurement (check wiki for values)

tracing the possible I/O around the chip and out to the pads

internal clock from RC oscillator (capacitor + resistor)

HF bath (~3% HF) for 1.5 minutes at a time, took 2 baths
HF heated in water bath to heat evenly and limit temp to 100C
delayered top metal layer + overglass

unknown chip was 1 metal, 1 poly, 1 active

likely implant mask ROM
    - no visible bits (not via, metal)
    - can't be optically read out
    - need to perform dash etching
        - nitric acid, glacial acetic acid, stronger HF acid

mask ROM types:
via: Transistor is there all the time, connect or disconnect it with a via
metal: Transistor is there all the time, short it out or don't with the metal
implant: Transistor is there all the time, fabricate the transistor to have a higher or lower voltage threshold (Vt) to either be always on or always off
Transistor is there or not

It's likely NOT mask ROM anymore
    It has a VPP pin, which hints at programming capabilities
